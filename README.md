## üöÄ Current Full Flow

1. **Upload pitch deck as PDF** 
2. **Transform to images** ‚Üí passed to OpenAI Vision API for text extraction
3. **AI Analysis** ‚Üí extract structured insights (founders, problem, solution, etc.)
4. **Founder Lookup** (optional):
   - Extract founder names from analysis
   - Look up in Google Custom Search Engine (LinkedIn only)
   - Retrieve LinkedIn username (e.g., `l-mangallon`)
   - Fetch full profile from LinkedIn API via Unipile



# PDF Pitch Deck Analyzer

**Purpose:** Extract text from PDF pitch decks with tricky fonts and encodings, then analyze them with AI.

**Problem encountered with traditional PDF libraries:**

-   Fail on special fonts and encodings -> unreliable    

**Solution 1:**
-   Use an OCR Library
Problem: this is a fast test I want it deployed on Render without dockerisation, and PyTesselate requires OS-level install 

**Problem with fallback approach:**
You could use a regular Python lib for reading pdf and only IF text is not clear then use encoding
This has to be done carefully cause with our test files some files had both clear text and encoded text, resulting in fallback not happening


**Solution Final:**

-   Convert PDF pages to images.
-   Use **OpenAI Vision** for text extraction.
-   Analyze with AI agent for structured insights.

We use Unipile to access Linkedin API
(provide api access to various socials, used by lemlist...)


With Unipile you can retrieve a profile  using the last part of url:
l-mangallon in 
https://www.linkedin.com/in/l-mangallon/
(It is not always formatted the same way)

The API can not lookup people, if the linkedin account is "standard"


So the solution without using a business linkedin account is to use Custom Search JSON API
The engine has been setup to look only on linkedin domain
so it can takes a regular request and return the url part that the unipile API needs to retrieve a profile


## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

### 1. Google LinkedIn Search Tool (`google_linkedin_search_tool.py`)
n profiles using Google Custom Search API.

**Helper Functions:**
- `get_linkedin_usernames_liry, num_results)` - Returns list of usernames
- `google_linkedin_search_raw(query, num_results)` - Returns raw API response

### 2. LinkedIn Search Tool (`linkedin_search_tool.py`)

Fetches detailed LinkedIn profiles using Unipile API.

```python
analyze_pitchdeck(
    file_path: str,
    verbose: bool = True,
    force_ocr: bool = False,
    lookup_founders: bool = False  # Enable LinkedIn lookup
)
```
